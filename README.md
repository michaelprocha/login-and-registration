# Login and Registration

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with ReactJS.
The application consists of two pages: Login and Register, with client-side navigation managed by React Router, ensuring seamless transitions without full page reloads.

Component state and form handling are managed using React’s useState hook, allowing controlled inputs and local state management for authentication data.
The entire user interface is styled using Styled Components, providing modular, reusable, and component-scoped styling.
